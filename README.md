# Data analysis UTM Students Survey

Our team were to assign to analize a survey that we create by using Google Form and process it to a usable Information

E-wallet is a form of an electronic card that may be used to make online purchases using a
computer or smartphone. It serves the same purpose as a credit or debit card in that it is used
to pay for the items we purchase. To make payments, an E-wallet must be linked to the user's
bank account. An e-wallet is a form of pre-paid account that allows a user to save money for
future online transactions. A password protects an electronic wallet. An E-wallet can be used
to pay for groceries, online shopping, and plane tickets, among other things. During the
covid-19 pandemic in Malaysia, many shopping malls and stores use E-wallet as the main
payment because it prevents the virus from spreading to other people. Nowadays, many
people are comfortable using E-wallet to pay for their things in daily life as it is convenient
and fast rather than paying using money.

The research we conducted was collecting the information from relevant sources to find the
answer to our research about the usage of E-wallet among Universiti Teknologi Malaysia
(UTM) to know more about their experience using the E-wallet in daily life
